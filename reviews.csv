"R2QM4TQCADG50N","Ashok Das","¬†Wanted 2 buy iPhone 14pro or max as the picture displayed like similar when you compare iPhone with pro and max. Hence it is Amazon who should have given me an options for various colors while loading and to choose from its 14 series..late uploaded though as I bought it as on sep 24th 2022.In regards the phone it is just like a cream in your hand , immensely smooth and the performance is at par. I would rate the rear camera A++ however they should have offered the charger at least along with cable.","Reviewed in India on 15 October 2022","Nice phone but could be improved more",4,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51sWXz4sabL.jpg

"R3QN7WHCT1NEQA","Prasanna","About the phoneApple phone without a second delay, I would say it is better than all android phones I have used. The phone is like water, it flows in a way you want and shaping in your way. In a best way possible, the phone is designed to only show what the user wants and eliminating unnecessary ads, features that I have seen in android.Why it is better than Android?You pay too much money for Apple products, obviously you experience the features, physical components , camera lens etc. Apart from basic things, you can also enjoy the best applications available in app store. If you are a developer you might know the app store policy for application publish and their security posture towards handling payment apps etc. They publish best application and the way the apps, its modules switches is just flawless. Due to the so called strict policy of privacy program with Apple products, iPhone can pop up a box in your screen if any apps wants to track your activity with other applications. +1 respect for apple to show such concern with user.Apple phones are same ? like 13 vs 14The reason 14 is same as 13 may be business practice followed from 11th edition. But please note that iPhone making changes internally like physical components (small change in battery performance, lens in 14 edition), additional features but that may not satisfy you to buy 14 edition. If you do not find ""the very few changes"" interesting in 14,  go for 13. Because physical and even cameras are not visually very much different in 13 vs 14 comparison. Also you get 13 for cheap :)14 is just added features but that is not for daily use, the features real time use is rare case. But the best part is there is no extra cost between 13 vs 14 prices (except extra 10k slash)Concern you must have.Apple is not giving chargers and their silicon cases are very expensive (but very good in touch and scratch friendly in back due to silk layer). This is an issue for sure. You have to buy charger not coming with USB C and claiming that you help carbon footprint, understandable but not customer friendly business model. Even after the purchase I had to spend at least 7k for charger and case.Apple care.I am not buying it, I pay for phone which is already expensive for this premium and apple care does have strict policy that if you understand that is waste. Instead I find a private insurance to make things better.","Reviewed in India on 22 September 2022","Exceeding my expectation. Go for it.",5,"","114","Red","128 GB"
